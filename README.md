**Integration of GWAS Data for Related Diseases**

Conducted an integrative analysis of datasets for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The integrative approach identified more disease-related SNPs than single-disease analysis, significantly improving the accuracy of variant detection. 

Explored the GPA (Genetic and Annotation Integration) model to enhance the ability to identify risk variants.
